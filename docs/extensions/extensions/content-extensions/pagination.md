# Continuation

Learn how to add pagination to a content extension.

Copy page

In a content extension, there's a limit to how many resources—[images](https://www.canva.dev/docs/extensions/extensions/content-extensions/content-types/images/), [embeds](https://www.canva.dev/docs/extensions/extensions/content-extensions/content-types/embeds/), or [containers](https://www.canva.dev/docs/extensions/extensions/content-extensions/content-types/containers/)—can be returned in a single response. This limit ensures that resources are loaded quickly.

To provide users with more resources than this limit allows, they need to be loaded across multiple requests. In some APIs, this is known as _pagination_. In the content extension API, it's known as _continuation_. The terms, however, can be used interchangeably.

The best way to understand pagination is with a practical example, so this topic explains how to implement pagination for [Lorem Picsum⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://picsum.photos), an API for placeholder photos. This API is free and registration is not required.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes experience with:

  * REST APIs
  * Node.js
  * Express.js



You should have also completed the [Quickstart for content extensions](https://www.canva.dev/docs/extensions/quickstart/).

## Step 1: Set up a content extension

  1. Create an app via the Developer Portal.

  2. Add a content extension to the app.

  3. Set up a REST API with [Glitch⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://glitch.com) and Express.js:
         
         const express = require("express");
         
         const app = express();
         
         
         
         
         app.use(express.json());
         
         app.use(express.static("public"));
         
         
         
         
         // Routes go here
         
         
         
         
         app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);

JAVASCRIPT

Copy




## Step 2: Load the initial page of resources

When a user opens a content extension, Canva sends a `POST` request to `/content/resources/find`:
    
    
    app.post("/content/resources/find", async (request, response) => {
    
      console.log(request.body);
    
    });

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

The purpose of this request is to retrieve the resources that will appear in the side panel.

To retrieve a list of images from Lorem Picsum, we can send a `GET` request to the following URL:
    
    
    https://picsum.photos/v2/list

BASH

Copy

This request will return an array of images, with each image represented by an object with the following structure:
    
    
    {
    
      "id": "0",
    
      "author": "Alejandro Escamilla",
    
      "width": 5616,
    
      "height": 3744,
    
      "url": "https://unsplash.com/...",
    
      "download_url": "https://picsum.photos/..."
    
    }

JSON

Copy

To retrieve a different page of images, we can append a `page` parameter to the URL:
    
    
    https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=2

BASH

Copy

To send HTTP requests, add the `axios` package to the project:

  1. Open the `package.json` file.
  2. Click **Add Package**.
  3. Search for "axios."
  4. Select the first result.



Then require the package at the top of the `server.js` file:
    
    
    const axios = require("axios");

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

To perform the request, call the `request` method:
    
    
    const options = {
    
      url: "https://picsum.photos/v2/list",
    
      params: {
    
        page: 1,
    
      },
    
    };
    
    
    
    
    const picsum = await axios.request(options);

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

Then convert the data into a format that Canva will understand:
    
    
    const images = picsum.data.map((image) => {
    
      return {
    
        type: "IMAGE",
    
        id: image.id,
    
        name: `Photo by ${image.author}`,
    
        url: image.download_url,
    
        thumbnail: {
    
          url: image.download_url,
    
        },
    
        contentType: "image/jpeg",
    
      };
    
    });
    
    
    
    
    response.send({
    
      type: "SUCCESS",
    
      resources: images,
    
    });

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

## Step 3: Provide the next page number in the response

Before a user reaches the end of the resource list, we want to trigger an additional request to `/content/resources/find`. This will allow us to seamlessly load additional resources, creating the effect of infinite scrolling.

To accomplish this, add a `continuation` property to the response:
    
    
    response.send({
    
      type: "SUCCESS",
    
      resources: images,
    
      continuation: "2",
    
    });

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

The presence of this property tells Canva that it should send another `POST` request to `/content/resources/find` before the user reaches the end of the list of resources. The value of this property will also be included in the body of that request.

In this example, the value of the `continuation` property is `"2"`. This is because we've loaded the first page of results and we would like to load the second page. But this value does not _have_ to be a page number. The only requirement is that this value is a string.

After making this change, scroll through the resources in the side panel.

The same resources will be repeatedly loaded. This isn't exactly what we want, but it's a step in the right direction.

## Step 4: Get the current page number from the request body

When a `continuation` property is included in a response, that same `continuation` property will be made available in the body of the next `POST` request that's sent to `/content/resources/find`.

To see an example of this, log the value of `request.body.continuation`:
    
    
    console.log(request.body.continuation);

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

When the first page of resources is loaded, the `continuation` property is `null`. This is because there isn't a previous response. But if you trigger another request by scrolling through the resources, the value of `"2"` will be logged. You can use this behavior to load unique resources for each request.

At the top of the route, before the `options` object, create a `currentPage` variable that contains the value of the request body's `continuation` property:
    
    
    const currentPage = request.body.continuation;

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

But since the `continuation` property will be `null` on the initial request, provide a fall-back value of `"1"`:
    
    
    const currentPage = request.body.continuation || "1";

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

Then update the `page` parameter in the `options` object to use this `currentPage` variable:
    
    
    const options = {
    
      url: "https://picsum.photos/v2/list",
    
      params: {
    
        page: currentPage,
    
      },
    
    };

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

Based on these changes, we'll be able to load the first and second pages of content into the side panel.

If we keep scrolling through the resources though, it's now the second page of images that will be repeatedly loaded. This is because we've hard-coded the value of the `continuation` property in all responses as `"2"`.

Even so, this is another step in the right direction.

## Step 5: Increment the page number

To load unique resources for every request, we need to increment the value of the `continuation` property.

Before the `response.send` method, create a variable that:

  1. Parses the number from the `currentPage` variable.
  2. Increments the page number by one.
  3. Converts the result back into a string.



This is an example of how to do that:
    
    
    const nextPage = (parseInt(currentPage, 10) + 1).toString();

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

Then provide this variable in the response:
    
    
    response.send({
    
      type: "SUCCESS",
    
      resources: images,
    
      continuation: nextPage,
    
    });

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

Based on this change, a unique set of resources will be loaded for each request.

## Step 6: Load the final page of resources

When the final page of resources is reached, don't provide a `continuation` property in the response:
    
    
    response.send({
    
      type: "SUCCESS",
    
      resources: images,
    
    });

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

...or set the `continuation` property to `null`:
    
    
    response.send({
    
      type: "SUCCESS",
    
      resources: images,
    
      continuation: null,
    
    });

JAVASCRIPT

Copy

This signifies that there's no more pages to load.

## Example
    
    
    const axios = require("axios");
    
    const express = require("express");
    
    const app = express();
    
    
    
    
    app.use(express.json());
    
    app.use(express.static("public"));
    
    
    
    
    app.post("/content/resources/find", async (request, response) => {
    
      const currentPage = request.body.continuation || "1";
    
    
    
    
      const options = {
    
        url: "https://picsum.photos/v2/list",
    
        params: {
    
          page: currentPage,
    
        },
    
      };
    
    
    
    
      const picsum = await axios.request(options);
    
    
    
    
      const images = picsum.data.map((image) => {
    
        return {
    
          type: "IMAGE",
    
          id: image.id,
    
          name: `Photo by ${image.author}`,
    
          url: image.download_url,
    
          thumbnail: {
    
            url: image.download_url,
    
          },
    
          contentType: "image/jpeg",
    
        };
    
      });
    
    
    
    
      const nextPage = (parseInt(currentPage, 10) + 1).toString();
    
    
    
    
      response.send({
    
        type: "SUCCESS",
    
        resources: images,
    
        continuation: nextPage,
    
      });
    
    });
    
    
    
    
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
