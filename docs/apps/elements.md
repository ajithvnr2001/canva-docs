# Elements

An introduction to elements in the Canva Developers SDK.

Copy page

In Canva, users can add _elements_ to their designs.

An element is a container that holds some kind of [content](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/content/), such as image content, and can be arranged in a user's design, such as by setting its dimensions and position.

Apps inside Canva can create and otherwise interact with elements in a variety of ways.

## Elements vs. content

Content is the underlying media or text that exists within an element. Elements are a container with a specific set of dimensions that holds content. For example, a user uploads their image content into the image element on their design.

**Content, however, doesn't always align with an element.**

For example, a page background may contain image content, but the page background isn't an image element. Similarly, a table cell may contain text content, but table cells aren't text elements.

If your app needs to operate on the elements of a design, see the following sections and code samples, as well as the [Design Editing](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/design-guidelines/design-editing-api/) guidelines for more information. If instead your app needs to edit the text, image, or video content found within the elements of a design, see the [Content](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/content/) guide, and the [Content Querying](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/design-guidelines/content-querying-api/) guidelines for more information.

## Element types

Apps can interact with wide variety of element types, including:

  * [Embeds](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/embedding-rich-media/)
  * [Images](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-images/)
  * [Groups](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/grouping-elements/)
  * [Shapes](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-shapes/)
  * [Tables](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-tables/)
  * [Text](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-text/)
  * [Richtext](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-text/)
  * [Videos](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-videos/)



To learn more about each element type, see the linked pages.

Additional types will be supported in the future.

## App elements

There's a special type of element called an _app element_. An app element is essentially a group element with metadata attached to it. This metadata allows the app to create custom, re-editable elements.

Although app elements share characteristics with elements in general, they're unique enough that they're documented separately. To learn more, see [App elements](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-app-elements/).

## Creating elements

Apps can create elements by calling either of the following methods:

  * `addElementAtPoint`
  * `addElementAtCursor`



Both methods add an element to the user's design, but:

  * `addElementAtPoint` accepts an (optional) position and is only compatible with design types that support absolute positions, which is all design types except for documents.
  * `addElementAtCursor` doesn't accept a position and is only compatible with design types that contain streams of text, which is only the document design type.



The supported elements also depend on the method being called:

Element type| addElementAtPoint| addElementAtCursor  
---|---|---  
Embeds| ✅| ✅  
Images| ✅| ✅  
Groups| ✅| ❌  
Shapes| ✅| ❌  
Tables| ✅| ✅  
Text| ✅| ✅  
Richtext| ✅| ✅  
Videos| ✅| ✅  
  
Where possible, apps should determine the context in which the app is running and either call the compatible method or make it obvious when functionality isn't available:
    
    
    import { Button, Rows } from "@canva/app-ui-kit";
    
    import { addElementAtCursor, addElementAtPoint } from "@canva/design";
    
    import { useFeatureSupport } from "@canva/app-hooks";
    
    import * as styles from "styles/components.css";
    
    
    
    
    export const App = () => {
    
      const isSupported = useFeatureSupport();
    
      const addElement = [addElementAtPoint, addElementAtCursor].find((fn) =>
    
        isSupported(fn),
    
      );
    
    
    
    
      function handleClick() {
    
        addElement?.({
    
          type: "text",
    
          children: ["Hello world"],
    
        });
    
      }
    
    
    
    
      return (
    
        <div className={styles.scrollContainer}>
    
          <Rows spacing="1u">
    
            <Button
    
              variant="primary"
    
              onClick={handleClick}
    
              disabled={!addElement}
    
              tooltipLabel={!addElement ? "This feature is not supported in the current page" : undefined}
    
            >
    
              Add element
    
            </Button>
    
          </Rows>
    
        </div>
    
      );
    
    };

## Positioning elements

The `addElementAtPoint` method accepts an optional set of dimensions and position:
    
    
    import { addElementAtPoint } from "@canva/design";
    
    
    
    
    // Upload an image asset
    
    const asset = await upload({
    
      type: "image",
    
      mimeType: "image/jpeg",
    
      url: "https://www.canva.dev/example-assets/image-import/image.jpg",
    
      thumbnailUrl:
    
        "https://www.canva.dev/example-assets/image-import/thumbnail.jpg",
    
      aiDisclosure: "none",
    
    });
    
    
    
    
    // Add the image to the design
    
    await addElementAtPoint({
    
      type: "image",
    
      ref: asset.ref,
    
      top: 50,
    
      left: 50,
    
      width: 1280,
    
      height: 720,
    
    });

TSX

Copy

These properties must be used together or not at all. If a position isn't provided, the element is added to the center of the design.

### Auto-calculating dimensions

You can set either the `width` or `height` properties to `"auto"`:
    
    
    import { addElementAtPoint } from "@canva/design";
    
    
    
    
    // Upload an image asset
    
    const asset = await upload({
    
      type: "image",
    
      mimeType: "image/jpeg",
    
      url: "https://www.canva.dev/example-assets/image-import/image.jpg",
    
      thumbnailUrl:
    
        "https://www.canva.dev/example-assets/image-import/thumbnail.jpg",
    
      aiDisclosure: "none",
    
    });
    
    
    
    
    // Add the image to the design
    
    await addElementAtPoint({
    
      type: "image",
    
      ref: asset.ref,
    
      top: 0,
    
      left: 0,
    
      width: 1280,
    
      height: "auto",
    
    });

TSX

Copy

This maintains the aspect ratio of the element without having to specify a pixel value.

### Rotating elements

The `addElementAtPoint` method accepts a rotation:
    
    
    import { addElementAtPoint } from "@canva/design";
    
    
    
    
    // Upload an image asset
    
    const asset = await upload({
    
      type: "image",
    
      mimeType: "image/jpeg",
    
      url: "https://www.canva.dev/example-assets/image-import/image.jpg",
    
      thumbnailUrl:
    
        "https://www.canva.dev/example-assets/image-import/thumbnail.jpg",
    
      aiDisclosure: "none",
    
    });
    
    
    
    
    // Add the image to the design
    
    await addElementAtPoint({
    
      type: "image",
    
      ref: asset.ref,
    
      top: 0,
    
      left: 0,
    
      width: 1280,
    
      height: "auto",
    
      rotation: 90,
    
    });

TSX

Copy

This rotation only has an effect if the element has dimensions and a position.

### Feature support for positioned elements

When positioning elements, you should check for feature support to make sure `addElementAtPoint` is supported in the current design type.

The positioning properties (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, and `rotation`) are only available when using the `addElementAtPoint` method. These properties aren't available with `addElementAtCursor`, which is designed for responsive documents that use a text-based flow.

Some element types, such as groups and shapes, require these positioning properties. For example, when creating a group, each child element must have `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` properties to define their position within the group.
    
    
    import { Button, Rows } from "@canva/app-ui-kit";
    
    import { addElementAtPoint } from "@canva/design";
    
    import { useFeatureSupport } from "@canva/app-hooks";
    
    import * as styles from "styles/components.css";
    
    
    
    
    export const App = () => {
    
      const isSupported = useFeatureSupport();
    
      const isAddElementAtPointSupported = isSupported(addElementAtPoint);
    
    
    
    
      function handleClick() {
    
        addElementAtPoint({
    
          type: "group",
    
          children: [
    
            {
    
              type: "shape",
    
              paths: [
    
                {
    
                  d: "M 0 0 H 100 V 100 H 0 L 0 0",
    
                  fill: { color: "#ff0099" },
    
                },
    
              ],
    
              viewBox: { width: 100, height: 100, top: 0, left: 0 },
    
              top: 0,
    
              left: 0,
    
              width: 100,
    
              height: 100,
    
            },
    
            {
    
              type: "shape",
    
              paths: [
    
                {
    
                  d: "M 50 0 L 100 100 L 0 100 Z",
    
                  fill: { color: "#00ff99" },
    
                },
    
              ],
    
              viewBox: { width: 100, height: 100, top: 0, left: 0 },
    
              top: 0,
    
              left: 110,
    
              width: 100,
    
              height: 100,
    
            },
    
          ],
    
        });
    
      }
    
    
    
    
      return (
    
        <div className={styles.scrollContainer}>
    
          <Rows spacing="1u">
    
            <Button
    
              variant="primary"
    
              onClick={handleClick}
    
              disabled={!isAddElementAtPointSupported}
    
              tooltipLabel={
    
                !isAddElementAtPointSupported
    
                  ? "Positioned elements are not supported in this design type"
    
                  : undefined
    
              }
    
            >
    
              Add positioned group
    
            </Button>
    
          </Rows>
    
        </div>
    
      );

For more information about groups and shapes, see [Grouping elements](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/grouping-elements/) and [Creating shapes](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/creating-shapes/).

## Element traversal

Apps can traverse the elements in a user's design. This allows the app to read and update the structure of the design and the content of its elements. To learn more, see [Design Editing API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/design-editing/).
